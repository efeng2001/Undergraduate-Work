================================ Questions ==================================

1. Did you use the 'suit', 'type' and 'value' arrays? What functions are easier
to implement when using these arrays? How do you use them?

:

2. Did you add any additional functions to your implementation? If so briefly
describe how the functions improved your solution.

:

3. There are many ways to shuffle the deck of cards. The method used in our
implementation generates a permutaion of the cards to shuffle. For an array of
size N, how many swap (exchange) operations does this algorithm do? Does the
algorithm require any extra memory to generate a permutation?
